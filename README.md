# practice-python
This repository features a range of small Python projects I worked on while exploring The Big Book of Small Python Projects by Al Sweigart. Some scripts follow the original structure closely to help me understand the flow, while others are built using my own logic or modifications.

The goal of this repo is to sharpen core programming skills, build logical thinking, and document my Python learning journey through hands-on practice.

Thanks alot Al Sweigart
